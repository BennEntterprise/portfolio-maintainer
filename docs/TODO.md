# Todo

[] Refactor: The Dropdown that handles ordering should be converted to chips/radio buttons so that it is easier to see all options.
[] Feat: Add icon to the card for private vs not private, (might need the designation "private" or   "visibility": "private")
[] Feat: Add an icon to indicate if there is a /docs/Todo.md file (case insensitive)
[] Feat: A "size" as a repo property and include it in the card.
[] Feat: Add License Value
[] Feat: Ensure pagination works and I can get all repos. (right now tops out at 100.)
[] Feat: Add an icon to show if a card has a README.md
