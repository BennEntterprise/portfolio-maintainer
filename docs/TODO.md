# Todo

# Uncategorized


## High Priority Todos

[] Look into the count of checks,x and ?s. Seems to be off...., Test with a smaller repo set so that there is a tighter iteration loop in my dev cycle
[] feat: MVP A settings tab where you can make different adjustments
[] feat: light/dark mode in settings. (Toggle Switch Sun/Moon)
[] Clean up the header. The settings icon should be over near the right, where a user avatar will eventually live.


## Medium Priority Todos

[] Perf: [typed hooks for dispatch and redux state](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/typescript#define-typed-hooks)
[] Devops: Add husky pre-commit hooks (lint and build)
[] Perf: Speed up the re-render on sorting/filter change. (Right now its several seconds because we RE-FEtch the repo tree multiple times.)
[] Devops: Containerize, release to Dockerhub and mark a release as V1
[] Show Branch number in the card, sort by branch count (requires hitting a separate URL and caching to be mindful of rate limits returning 429)

## Low Priority Todos

[] Show some sort of intermediate counter while the repos are loading so the user can understand that stuff is, in fact, happening in the background.
[] Refactor: The Dropdown that handles ordering should be converted to chips/radio buttons so that it is easier to see all options.
[] Feat: Use AGGrid to show all of the above items as a grid list, not just as cards.
[] Use the Repo.language value to display on the card info.
[] Implement [stack-analyser](https://github.com/specfy/stack-analyser?tab=readme-ov-file)

[x] 2024-12-04 T 17:13:07 Perf: Reduce calls to check for files (do it on one call to the repo instead of 3) {I was able to shave off a few seconds, but the biggest culprit was the call to get pull requests. And I don't have that on the repo object so it needs to stay. ðŸ¥².}
