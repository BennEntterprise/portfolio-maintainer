# Todo

## High Priority Todos

[] Feat: Ensure pagination works and I can get all repos. (right now tops out at 100.)s

## Medium Priority Todos

[] Feat: Left Sidebar Checkboxes to handle filtering. (archive/non-archive, organization)
[] Add husky pre-commit hooks (lint and build)

## Low Priority Todos

[] Refactor: The Dropdown that handles ordering should be converted to chips/radio buttons so that it is easier to see all options.
[] Feat: Use AGGrid to show all of the above items as a grid list, not just as cards.
