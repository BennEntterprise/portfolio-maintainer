# Todo

## High Priority Todos

[] Containerize, release to Dockerhub and mark a release as V1.

## Medium Priority Todos

[] Add husky pre-commit hooks (lint and build)
[] Save filter state in local storage (ensure it can reconcile)

## Low Priority Todos

[] Refactor: The Dropdown that handles ordering should be converted to chips/radio buttons so that it is easier to see all options.
[] Feat: Use AGGrid to show all of the above items as a grid list, not just as cards.
